### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: Are they disussing the same thing?
+ This project is conducted by Xiaoxue Ren

+ Project summary: The basic data set for this project is called philosophy data set, which is from Kaggle. This data set concludes text from different philosophers who belong to various schools of philosophy. My project is based on one of this school: feminism. Therefore, I conduct my data analysis based on subsets of this data set. I want to see how thoughts of feminists in different periods of times vary.
